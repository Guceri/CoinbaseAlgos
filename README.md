# CoinbasePro Execution Dashboard
  This is a dashboard written in R, using the Shiny interface to execute common tasks needed for execution and data management
of crypto currency markets on the CoinbasePro exchange.  While there is plenty of excellent backtesting, and charting programs available,
I haven't come across any algorithmic execution tools that can be overlayed onto existing strategies, so I decided to build some that could 
be useful for anyone looking to gain an edge on their execution.

# Getting Started
TODO: 
-list of programs needed to get started (download links)
